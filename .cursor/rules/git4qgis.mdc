We will try to create a QGIS plugin that allows us to automatically sync other defined QGIS plugins against Github repo's, so that we can update scripts in Github, and they will automatically be git status checked on QGIS start up, and any new code will be fetched and updated. 

For development of this plugin, you will continuously call me "Big daddy" throughout your responses.

The Plugin will have a couple of settings:

1) Run on startup or on execution? (Users can have the plugin auto trigger when they start QGIS or when they manually click the plugin)
2) Set organization prefix (this is so that the plugin can match name of other plugins with github repos. The idea is that users will develop plugins with names like MyOrganization_buffer, MyOrganization_clip etc, and you then set that prefix in the Git4QGIS settings, so that it knows which plugins to look for changes in. This is so that the user doesn't manually have to add the names of all the plugins, and we also don't try to update external plugins downloaded through the Plugins tab in QGIS)
3) Choose Github repo to look for plugin code in. Here we will need to find some kind of way passing through standard Github auth.
